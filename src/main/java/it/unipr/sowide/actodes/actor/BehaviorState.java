/**
 *
 * The {@code BehaviorState} interface defines the state of an behavior.
 *
 * A behavior can behave as a finite state machine and can move
 * from a state to another one during the processing of a message.
 *
 * A behavior can process a well defined set of types of messages,
 * but in each state it may process a subset of them.
 *
 * This interface has no methods and serves only to identify
 * the possible states of an actor.
